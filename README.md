This project was built in 3 days for HackAIthon. Our goal was to build an extension of GPT-3.5 that finds videos, generates knowledge graphs, and generates dynamic games to help students learn materials. This is just the front-end code and some elements of it are hard-coded to test server endpoints. To run it run
```
npm start
```
in the base directory.
